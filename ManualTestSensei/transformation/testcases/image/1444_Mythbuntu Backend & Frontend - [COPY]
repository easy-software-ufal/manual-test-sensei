    <dt>Go though the Ubiquity install as you would any other install. Most options won't matter for this testcase, but be sure to choose the following options</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li title="Specified Setting">Do NOT name the user mythtv</li>

    <dt>Once the installed system boots, it will boot into the MythTV frontend. Exit the frontend by hitting escape and selecting "yes, exit now"</dt>
    <dt>Download a demo file. I recommend a MP4 trailer (for example, the 480p MP4 trailer at http://www.sintel.org/download ).</dt>
    <dt>Once downloaded, move this file to the /srv/ directory (it must be outside your home directory)</dt>
    <dt>Change ownership on the test file to mythtv:mythtv</dt>
    <dt>Open the Applications menu and choose system and then "Mythtv backend setup".</dt>
    <dt>Say yes to stop the running mythtv-backend service</dt>
    <dt>Once in mythtv-setup, go to "1. General"</dt>
    <dt>On the first screen, edit the following options</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>

            </ul>
        </dd>
    <dt>Hit next until you get back to the main menu</dt>
    <dt>Go to "2. Capture cards" and select "(New capture card)"</dt>
    <dt>Setup the new card using the following options</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>

                <li title="Specified Setting">File path: file:/srv/sintel_trailer-480p.mp4</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
        <dd>When you put in the file path, it should detect the "File info" and "File size"</dd>
    <dt>Hit Finish, then escape to go back to the main menu</dt>
    <dt>Go to "4. Video sources" and select "(New video source)"</dt>
    <dt>Setup the video source with the following options</dt>

    <dt>Go to "5. Input connections", and select the only option in there (the DEMO recorder)</dt>
    <dt>Setup as follows</dt>
        <dd>
            <ul>
                <li title="Specified Setting">Video source: NoGrabber</li>
            </ul>
        </dd>
    <dt>Hit Next, then finish, then escape to go back to the main menu.</dt>
    <dt>Hit escape and exit the backend setup.</dt>
        <dd>You may get a warning that the tuner is set to start on a channel that doesn't exist. This can be safely ignored since we are using a test recorder.</dd>
    <dt>Select yes to start the backend</dt>
    <dt>Select no when prompted to run mythfilldatabase</dt>
    <dt>Start the frontend via Applications > Multimedia > MythTV Frontend </dt>
